# Check In Ticket System

Use this system to look up tickets and check them in (and out)!

Every ticket has a 10-digit ticket number (e.g. 8463727021). If the ticket exists and it's not checked in, it will be marked as checked in. If it's already checked in, an error will be shown to the user.

I'm using the JSON-Server package to create a fake REST API filled with randomly generated information.
